# Artist Statement: "The Witness is Fractured"

Photographs have always unsettled me. Susan Sontag writes that they "haunt us," and that lingering echo is where *The Witness is Fractured* begins. The work answers a simple prompt: take one thing that is "truly" beautiful, one that is "truly" ugly, press them together, and watch the sparks. My beautiful element is a hyper-real human eye—rendered with off-the-shelf AI, shimmering with the precision Kant called a "purposiveness without purpose." My ugly element is an archive of twenty-four war photographs: barbed-wire corpses, napalm burns, a beheading frozen mid-blade. Their ugliness is not stylistic but moral, what Burke would fold into the *sublime*: terror viewed from a safe distance.

The two are fused inside a touchscreen interface that functions like a Cubist canvas. Picasso shattered pictorial space so a viewer could never rest in one perspective; here, I fracture sight itself. The eye occupies the centre of a rotating HUD, while the photographs slide behind translucent panes, diced into metrics—hit-points, XP bars, rarity stars. The composition owes a debt to *Les Demoiselles d'Avignon* (1907): beauty and violence locked in the same frame, each forcing the other into new, uneasy shapes.

Why an eye? Because beauty seduces. Neuroscientists tell us an isolated iris triggers the fusiform face area; we feel watched, and we watch back. The interface leverages that reflex, inviting players to linger, to zoom, to collect. In beta tests most users stared at the eye first, unaware that a timer was silently scoring their voyeurism.

Why war photography? Because it resists aestheticisation—until it doesn't. Once statistics replace blood, atrocity becomes another data-driven collectible. Jean Baudrillard calls this *hyperreality*, a copy with no original; Guy Debord labels it the *spectacle*, life experienced at one remove. My HUD literalises both theories: every click turns a corpse into a point value, every swipe advances a progress bar titled "Historicity."

The result unsettles me. Beauty is not neutral; it can lull us into complicity. Ugliness is not invincible; repeated, quantified, and gamified, it loses its sting. Their combination exposes what Elaine Scarry warns about when she argues that beauty can either "press us toward" justice or anesthetise us against pain. Here it tends toward the latter: players keep playing even as the imagery grows more grotesque, because the feedback loop feels good.

Reflecting on the build, I began to read Picasso differently. Early Cubism was condemned as ugly, even monstrous, yet history now enshrines it as beautiful. Value shifts with context; the eye and the war photos may undergo the same drift once they leave the gallery and head to Instagram. That instability is, finally, the point: the witness is not only fractured, but fickle.

*The Witness is Fractured* runs about five minutes if you chase every badge. There is no win state. When the credits roll the eye still stares, unblinking, reminding us that the game never really ends. Awareness alone is insufficient, but perhaps it is a start.
